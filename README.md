# Object-Detection
Object Detection like Person, animals using python libraries.

change the CustomObjects to your liking to detect different objects, like if you want to detect "car" then add car = True in the argument for detector.CustomObjects.Also, change the name of the image you want to validate. By doing this you will be enabling the code to look for cars in the training model and you will be able to get the predicted probability of a object being a car.
